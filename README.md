Data Structures Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures Practice repository! This repository contains various implementations of fundamental data structures using Python, along with example programs and basic operations for each structure.

📚 Introduction

This repository is designed to help me and others understand and practice core data structures by implementing them from scratch using Python. Each data structure has its own folder containing:
- A Python file with the implementation.
- Example code demonstrating the basic operations (e.g., insertion, deletion, etc.).
- An explanation of the time complexity for each operation in the respective file.

The goal is to strengthen understanding and build intuition for how these data structures work and how they are used in real-world scenarios.

🛠️ Implemented Data Structures

Here is a list of the data structures currently implemented:

Linear Data Structures
- Stack: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
- Queue: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
- Linked List: Singly and Doubly linked lists.

Non-Linear Data Structures
- Binary Tree: Basic binary tree with traversal methods.
- Binary Search Tree: Binary tree with properties of a search tree.
- Heap: Min-Heap and Max-Heap implementations.

Advanced Data Structures
- Hash Table: Implementation of hash maps using Python dictionaries.
- Graph: Adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations.

More data structures will be added over time as I continue practicing.

🚀 How to Use

To run any of the programs or try out the data structures:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-practice.git
   cd data-structures-practice
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the data structure you're interested in.

3. Run the Python file to see the implementation and example operations.

   ```bash
   python stack.py
   ```

Each folder contains a standalone implementation, so you can explore and run any file independently.

👨‍💻 Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by adding new data structures or optimizing existing ones. If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Submit a pull request.

All contributions are welcome, including improvements to the documentation, refactoring of code, or implementing new data structures.

Happy coding! 😊
